## 🔧 Main Features (to be implemented)

### ✅ Sensors & Monitoring
- [ ] Read temperature and humidity using a **DHT22** sensor.
- [ ] Measure soil moisture with a **capacitive soil sensor**.
- [ ] Measure ambient light with an **LDR or photodiode**.
- [ ] Log all sensor data regularly.
- [ ] Display data on **LCD Screen**.

### ⚙️ Control System
- [ ] Automatically activate a **water pump** based on soil moisture.
- [ ] Control a **fan or heater** to regulate temperature.
- [ ] Use **LED grow lights** when ambient light is insufficient.

### 🔋 Power Management
- [ ] Power the system via **solar panels + battery pack**.
- [ ] Monitor battery voltage and manage energy usage.

### 📡 Communication
- [ ] Transmit sensor datas via **BLE**.
- [ ] Interact with the greenhouse through a **web app**.

### 📈 Data Visualization
- [ ] Store data locally or on a server.
- [ ] Visualize data with **Grafana**.
